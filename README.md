# Fabric_EMS

TL;DR - A custom board and code for integrating electronics (especially EMS) into fabric garments.

We have built a prototype two-channel EMS board, that is designed to be easily incorporated into fabrics.
A range of pins, and the EMS output, are all made available through holes that can easily be interfaced
to conductive thread. 

This is an early prototype that is still under active development. More details to follow.
