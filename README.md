Temera is a soft, finnles, Sleeper Ray, with paired electric organs. Temera is also a platform for creating soft circuits with paired EMS stimulation outputs.

Specifically, Temera is a prototype two-channel EMS shield, designed to be easily incorporated into fabrics.
16 GPIO that can be set to Analog Input as well as 2 Channels of EMS are broken out. In addition to pins, we added holes, so that each channel can easily be connected to using conductive thread. 

This is an early prototype that is still under active development. More details to follow.
